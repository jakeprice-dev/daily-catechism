  Question_25: 
    Question: "Does Christ's death mean all our sins can be forgiven?"

    Question: "How can we be saved?"
    Answer: "Only by faith in Jesus Christ and in his substitutionary atoning death on the cross; so even though we are guilty of having disobeyed God and are still inclined to all evil, nevertheless, God, without any merit of our own but only by pure grace, imputes to us the perfect righteousness of Christ when we repent and believe in him."

  Question_30:

  Question_31: 
    Question: "What do we believe by true faith?"

He descended into hell. The third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.

  Question_33: 
    Question: "Should those who have faith in Christ seek their salvation through their own works, or anywhere else?"

    References: ""

  Question_34: 
    Question: "Since we are redeemed by grace alone, through Christ alone, must we still do good works and obey God's Word?"
    Answer: "Yes, because Christ, having redeemed us by his blood, also renews us by his Spirit; so that our lives may show love and gratitude to God; so that we may be assured of our faith by the fruits; and so that by our godly behavior others may be won to Christ."

    References: ""

  Question_44: 
    Question: "What is baptism?"

    References: ""

  Question_45: 
    Question: "Is baptism with water the washing away of sin itself?"

    References: ""

  Question_46: 
    Question: "What is the Lord's Supper?"

    References: ""

  Question_47: 
    Question: "Does the Lord's Supper add anything to Christ's atoning work?"
    Answer: "No, Christ died once for all. The Lord's Supper is a covenant meal celebrating Christ's atoning work; as it is also a means of strengthening our faith as we look to him, and a foretaste of the future feast. But those who take part with unrepentant hearts eat and drink judgement on themselves."

    Question: "What does Christ's resurrection mean for us?"
    Answer: "Christ triumphed over sin and death by being physically resurrected, so that all who trust in him are raised to new life in this world and to everlasting life in the world to come. Just as we will one day be resurrected, so this world will one day be restored. But those who do not trust in Christ will be raised to everlasting death."

  Question_51: 
    Question: "Of what advantage to us is Christ's ascension?"
